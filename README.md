# BookMatch - Semantic Book Recommender

This project is a **semantic book recommendation system** that leverages **large language models (LLMs)** to deliver meaningful, emotion-aware, content-based book suggestions. Built using Python, LangChain, and Gradio, the system transforms book descriptions into mathematical embeddings to power vector search and enable rich interaction through a user-friendly dashboard.
